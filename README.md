Comments - Our Methodology won the 1st Place in both the Binary with 90.8% Accuracy and Multi-Class 92% Accuracy (0.857 Kappa Score) Deep Learning Based Classification Challenges.

How to Run the Code?

1. Train the Architectures with your Preferences and/or Requirements, or better Devise your Own using the Referred PyTorch Example.
2. Play with the Hyperparameters and Different Architecture Configurations. It is my favourite part.
3. Have Fun Transfering/Learning the Learnings. 
4.
